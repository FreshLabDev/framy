# Changelog

All notable framy changes are documented here.

The `## <tag>` section of this file *is* the GitHub Release body: the release
workflow copies it verbatim and refuses a tag that has no section. Write it
for whoever has to decide whether to upgrade.

See [`docs/versioning.md`](docs/versioning.md) for what the numbers mean and
[`docs/releases.md`](docs/releases.md) for how a release is published.

## Unreleased

Nothing is released yet. The repository holds the design, the research it
was written from, and the skeleton of the service.

### Added

- The Go service skeleton. Configuration comes from the environment, and any
  secret can instead come from a file named by `NAME_FILE`, as Docker secrets
  do. PostgreSQL is used in the `framy` schema, with migrations embedded in
  the binary. Long polling records every sender, and every group framy is in,
  in `core` through `core.touch`. `Preflight` runs before polling starts.
  `/healthz` reports the version, the database and how fresh polling is.
  SIGTERM stops polling and the HTTP server within 20 seconds.
- `/start` and the family's panels, in the sixteen languages of the family
  and the shape every sibling bot uses (`core/docs/panels.md`): home, help,
  about and the language picker in a direct chat; in a group `/start` is
  ephemeral, so the panel reaches only the one who asked, with the group's
  language for its admins. The language is core's, shared with the other bots:
  a pick writes a manual observation and Follow Telegram withdraws it. The
  command menu and the profile descriptions are published per language at
  start, and a description is written only when it changed.
- `/metrics` with framy's counters in the Prometheus text format, on its own
  listener (`METRICS_ADDR`, `:9090` by default), apart from the public one.
- CI on every push and weekly: modules, gofmt, build, vet, race tests,
  database tests on PostgreSQL 17, govulncheck, the image build and the local
  Compose file. A tag publishes the image to GHCR and the GitHub Release only
  after CI passed on the tagged commit. Dependabot opens grouped updates
  against `dev`.

- `docs/design.md`: what framy is, the surfaces (site, Mini App, groups, DMs),
  accounts through Telegram, providers and people's keys, the model catalog,
  prices in USD and the person's currency, the free allowance, jobs, `/f` in a
  group with albums, storage in Cloudflare R2, security and operations, the
  changes framy needs in `tg`, and the stages.
- `docs/research/`: the research of 26 October 2026 behind the design, in
  Russian, with sources: image and video models, providers, Telegram, and how
  to build and run the service.
